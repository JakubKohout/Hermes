Project Hermes
========================

This is just college project, which doesn't make any sense for real production unless some travel agency company would like to buy it :)


1) Installing project Hermes
----------------------------------

When it comes to installing this project you need to follow these steps.
First of all clone this repository to your computer or server.

### Use Composer

Composer is used for managing dependencies on others packages.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Please install all dependecies by running command:

    composer install


2) Update configuration file
----------------------------

Default configuration file is located at /app/config/parameters.conf.dist
Rename this file to parameters.conf and edit all required values.

You will need MySQL 5.3+ server.


3) Generating database structure and fixtures
---------------------------------------------

Project is using migrations, so every change of database could be reverted. Getting actual version of db schema could be done by this command:

    php app/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

Be careful with this command on production server, you shouldn't run this command unless you know what you are doing

### Generating fixtures

Default data can be generated by running this command:

    php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load

It will *erase whole database* and generate new fixtures!


4) Finalizating
----------------------

DocumentRoot should be pointed to directory /web/
Also make sure that folders /app/logs and /app/temp are writeable

Default login and password are *admin@hermes.com* and *admin*
